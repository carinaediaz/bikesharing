# Bike Sharing
## Overview
#####
## Results
##### We created several visualizations to help our investors see the trends in bikesharing use in NYC, using this as a model for our bikesharing program in Des Moines.

##### Most users trips last less than 30 minutes, with the most being 5 minutes in duration.

##### When filter the data by gender, we see similar trends for males and females, but users with an unknown gender peak closer to 10 minutes.

##### Trips during the work week are concentrated around commuting hours. Less usage on the weekends overall.

##### When filter the data by gender, we see similar trends for all genders.

##### There are more trips taken on Thursdays and Fridays, for all genders.

##### Most users are male. 
## Summary
##### While the information we found on popular hours, user types, and trip duration are helpful, we must understand that this is based on NYC data. NYC has a population of approximately 8.3 million people vs Des Moines which has a population of approximately 215,000 people. NYC also attracks a lot of visitors year round, further increasing the scope of users. We must scale the data to estimate the demand our bikesharing program may produce. We should aslo take into consideration that NYC is not as car-friendly of a city as Des Moines, with public transportation, walking, or biking sometimes taking less time than driving short distances. Additionally, people in Des Moines may not live within biking distance of their job. These are all items we should consider when attempting to apply our findings to a program in Des Moines. 
##### Additional visualizations that we could create could be related to the distance and location of trips. Are there trends for where people begin/end their trips during the work week vs the weekend? How far is the average trip during the work week vs the weekend? Finding more information about where bikes begin/end will help us find areas where bikes may need to be moved to if it is a highly popular start location, but not a popular end location, and vice versa.
